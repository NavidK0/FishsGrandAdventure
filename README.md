# What is this?

This mod adds a bunch of unique events into the game which randomly roll every time you go to a new moon.

The events are not just value updates, but actual game-changing events. Some good, some bad, some just plain awesome.
Imagine Super Mario Wonder, but it's Lethal Company.

This mod was originally based on Brutal Company by u-2018. I have since rewritten most of it and changed a lot of how it
works.

# Inspirations and Credits

Brutal Company by u-2018 - https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/2018/Brutal_Company/

# Prerequisites

This mod patches a lot of the game, so it's required by both the server and client.  
Required mods should be loaded automatically by the manifest.

# Additions (besides the events)

### Danger Level

The original mod had a concept called "Heat" that it used to effect enemy spawn rates and such.  
This has been changed to "Danger" and works somewhat differently.

### Custom Moons

This mod adds some custom levels. They are:

- Seth's Fridge
- (more to come)

Nothing. Yes.
